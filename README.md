# R_MixedEffectTutorial

This repo is for the NYU Neuroscience Postdoc-led Workshop: Mixed-effect modeling (Feb 10, 2023)

During the workshop, I made significant modifications to the [original work](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/03/15/mixed-models.html), including:

1. Incorporating a discussion and visualization of multilevel nested designs
2. Adding a model with a random slope but no random intercept
3. Demonstrating the use of lmerTest
4. Providing recommended readings for further understanding.
